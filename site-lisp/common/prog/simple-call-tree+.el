;;; Commentary: 
;; 
;; This library is based on simple-call-tree.el by Alex Schroeder.
;; It displays a buffer containing a call tree for functions in source
;; code files. You can easily & quickly navigate the call tree, displaying
;; the code in another window, and perform query-replace on the functions
;; which may be useful for refactoring.

;; When the command `simple-call-tree-display-buffer' is executed
;; a call tree for the functions in the current buffer will be created.
;; The user is also prompted for other files containing functions to be
;; included in the call tree.
;; The call tree is displayed in a buffer called *Simple Call Tree*,
;; which has a dedicated menu in the menu-bar showing various commands
;; and their keybindings. Most of these commands are self explanatory
;; so try them out.

;; You can navigate the call tree either by moving through consecutive
;; headers (n/p or N/P keys) or by jumping to main branches (j for branch
;; corresponding to function at point, and J to prompt for a function).
;; When you jump to a branch, it is added to `simple-call-tree-jump-ring',
;; and you can navigate your jump history using the </> keys.
;; You can also add the function under point to the jump-ring with the . key.
;; If you use a negative prefix (e.g. C--) before pressing j then the branch
;; jumped to will not be added to the jump-ring.
;; If you have fm.el (available here: http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/sje30/emacs/fm.el)
;; you can press f to toggle follow mode on/off.
;; When follow mode is on, or when you press the v or C-o key the code line
;; corresponding to the branch under point will be displayed. If it is a
;; toplevel branch then that function will be displayed, if it is a lower-level
;; branch then the corresponding function call will be displayed.
;; You can invert the tree by pressing i, and change the depth by pressing d.
;; You can toggle narrowing to the current branch by pressing /.
;; You can perform query-replace or query-replace-regexp on the function at
;; point by pressing % or C-%

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put simple-call-tree+.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'simple-call-tree+)
;;
;; You might also want to define a key for creating the call tree, 
;; e.g. like this:
;;
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c S") 'simple-call-tree-display-buffer)




;;; Customize:
;;
;; `simple-call-tree-default-recenter' : How to recenter the window after moving to another function in the "*Simple Call Tree*" 
;;                                       buffer.
;; `simple-call-tree-jump-ring-max' : Maximum number of elements in `simple-call-tree-jump-ring', before old elements are removed.


;;
;; All of the above can customized by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET simple-call-tree+ RET
;;

;;; Change log:
;;	
;; 2012/11/01
;;      * First released.

;;

;;; TODO
;;
;; I am going to work on a plugin for one-key.el which provides similar functionality.
;; If anyone wants to implement the following ideas, please do:
;; More reliable code for building tree (handle duplicate function names properly).
;; Fix code so that we can have several calls to the same function in the same tree.
;; Code for marking functions (like with files in dired mode) and then applying operations to the marked functions.
;; Code for rearranging functions.
;; Code for renaming functions.

  "Alist of major modes, and information to use for identifying objects for the simple call tree.
Each element is a list in the form '(MAJOR-MODE VALID-FONTS INVALID-FONTS START-TEST END-TEST) where:

MAJOR-MODE is the symbol for the major-mode that this items applies to.

VALID-FONTS is either nil or a list of fonts for finding objects for the call tree (functions/variables/etc).
If nil then `simple-call-tree-default-valid-fonts' will be used.

INVALID-FONTS is either nil or a list of fonts that should not be present in the text properties of
any objects to be added to the call tree. If nil then `simple-call-tree-default-invalid-fonts' will be used.
The invalid fonts will also be checked when finding function calls.

START-TEST indicates how to determing the start of the next object. Potential objects are found by checking
the fonts of tokens in the buffer (against VALID-FONTS). If START-TEST is a function then it will be used as
an additional check for potential objects. It will be passed the buffer position of the beginning of the
current token to check, and should return non-nil if it represents a valid object.

NEXT-FUNC is an alternative way of determining the locations of functions.
It is either nil, meaning the function locations will be determined by fonts and maybe START-TEST,
or a function of no args which moves point to the start of the next function in the buffer.

END-FUNC indicates how to find the end of the current object when parsing a buffer for the call tree.
It is either nil, meaning that font changes will be used to determine the end of an object,
or a function of no args which moves point to the end of the current function in the buffer.

START-REGEXP a regular expression to match the beginning of a token, you can probably leave this blank.
By default it is \"\\_<\".

END-REGEXP a regular expression to match the end of a token, by default this is \"\\_>\"."
